This is the repository for [Python Internals for Developers
](https://bpbonline.com/products/python-internals-for-developers?_pos=1&_sid=6da46c083&_ss=r),published by BPB Publications. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the journey of this book.

## About the Book
This book will aid you in your learning of the Python 3.x programming language. The chapters in this book will benefit every aspect of a programmer's or developer's life by preparing them to solve problems using Python programming and its key data structures and internals.

This book explains the built-in and user-defined data structures in Python 3.x. The book begins by introducing Python, its fundamental data structures, and asymptotic notations. Once you master the fundamentals of Python, you'll be able to fully comprehend the built-in data structures. The book covers real-world applications to understand user-defined data structures and their actual implementation. Towards the end, it will help you investigate how to solve practical problems by first comprehending the issue at hand.

After reading this book, you will be able to identify data structures and utilize them to solve a specific problem. You will learn about various algorithm implementations in Python and use this knowledge to advance your Python skills.

## What You Will Learn
•	Calculate the complexity of time and space using asymptotic notations.

•	Discover Python 3.x's built-in and user-defined data structures.

•	Create user-defined data structures from the bottom up.

•	Make use of libraries to create new user-defined data structures.

•	Determine and implement the most appropriate data structure for resolving issues.
